# The Task

This task is to build the fake business model and predict revenue. Find detailed task description at the bottom of this document.
If something is unclear or incorrect in the description below - change it the way you think it should be.
If something is taking too much time for you - drop, don't waste your time, work on other tasks.

# Business model description


### Basic terms

- Company - we are the company
- Client (meaning a set of clients) - the one who pay us money
- Job - Company does some job for a Client using __one__ subcontractor
- Subcontractor (set of subscontractors) - Guys who actually do all the job behind the scenes. Client does not know anything about contractor. Only Company deals with Subcontractor (always 1 Subcontractor for every single Job)

### Basic flow

- One of our clients requests a job
- Job can be accepted or rejected by our Company

### Job accepted scenario:

- Company accepted `start_date` of this job set by Client
- Company starts working on this job starting from requested `start_date`
- Company estimates and sets `end_date` to this Job
- Company sends invoice to the Client
  - Invoice `due_amount` is equal to `rate_set_for_the_client$ * (end_date - start_date).days`
  - Invoice gets `pending` status
  - Client has to pay for this invoice on any date __before__ `end_date`
  - Invoice hasn't been paid in time scenario:
    - Invoice gets status `overdue`
    - On each day after `end_date` we add `rate_set_for_the_client$` amount to the invoice
    - The Client can't request any new job
  - Invoice has been paid in time scenario:
    - Invoice gets status `paid`
    - Client has an ability to add a new job
- Company finds Subcontractor who is not too busy with other jobs: should have less than 3 jobs assigned
- The Subcontractor gets paid once the job assigned to him is done
- The Subcontractor is paid only for number of days he actually worked:
- Amount paid to subcontractor: `subcontractor.rate * (end_date - start_date).days`
- Company can change Job's `end_date`:
  - Invoice `due_amount` should be recalculated accordingly
  - If Client already paid for the Invoice:
    - If `paid_amount > due_amount` then send money to virtual Client's "local" account (stored in our db)
    - If `paid_amount < due_amount` change `invoice_status` back to `pending`
- Client gets discount once they paid for 3 jobs (as regular customer)
- Discount percentage is set in application config `config/application.yml`
- Client may loose discount if one of their invoices is marked as `overdue`

### Job rejected scenario:

- Company rejected Client's request
- Client has to create new job, the one which is rejected is no longer in use

## Finally your task:

Calculate the following values:

### Revenue

Revenue is calculated as `SUM(invoices.paid_amount) - SUM(subcontractor_payouts.amount)`.

### Gross sales

Gross sales is equal to `SUM(invoices.paid_amount)`

### Rejection rate

Percentage of jobs rejected by the Company

### Predicted revenue

Predict revenue for: next month, next year. Take any valid acceptable algorythm.

Also include in report:

- Standard deviation (if possible)
- Worst case / best case revenue

### Per user stats

Calculate for any given period (set by user):

- Top 5 best clients (based on total __revenue__ impact)
- Top 5 worst clients
- Best subcontractor (based on total __revenue__ impact). Think more about this one.
- Worst Client by number of overdue days at the current moment

## Required performance

Take 100000 Clients and 50000 working Subcontractors. Performance is acceptable if you feel comfortable with it :)
